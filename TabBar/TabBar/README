This is an iOS app I made for managing my favorite Movies, Music, Books, and Courses. It has a tab bar with four sections, each showing a list of items with images and titles. When you tap an item, it opens a detail page with more information and my personal review. I used UIKit, Storyboard, table views, and navigation controllers to build it, and set up constraints so it works on different iPhone screens. The app is mostly for demonstration, showing how lists and detail pages work in a clean and simple layout.

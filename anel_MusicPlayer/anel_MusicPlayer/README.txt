In this laboratory work i created a simple music player that can import mp3 files from ur real devices folders. Also the time slidebar and buttons with labels were implemented. Also you can list the music files with the help of tableview and choose the song to start with. It will be implemented further, because the secondary tasks, the bonus tasks, are not fully added to the existing project, only the main requirements were met.
